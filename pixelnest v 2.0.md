PixelNest Creative Gallery - Version 2.0 Release Notes
This new version represents a significant update, elevating the portfolio's aesthetic and user experience with expressive Material 3 design principles, dynamic motion, and substantial performance enhancements.

What's New:
- Expressive Material 3 UI: The entire website now embraces an expressive Material 3 (M3) design. This includes a dynamic, user-generated color palette that allows visitors to personalize the entire site theme by selecting a source color. A dedicated light/dark mode toggle button is also integrated for a seamless viewing experience.

- Enhanced Animations and Motions: The portfolio grid features new, silky-smooth fade and slide animations, now optimized with requestAnimationFrame for a highly performant and fluid browsing experience. A new page dedicated to UI/UX feedback showcases a vivid, animated gradient background and a modern "glassmorphism" effect for the form.

- Interactive Audio Experience: The 'Auralis' page now features an interactive, generative ambient music player, powered by the Tone.js library, creating an immersive and dynamic soundscape.

Bug Fixes & Improvements:
- Download Feature Improvement: The image download functionality has been enhanced to ensure higher reliability and consistency across different browsers and devices, addressing previous issues that prevented downloads on specific platforms.

Web App Optimization:

- Loading: The website has been optimized for faster initial load times and more efficient resource handling.

- Performance: A new scroll throttling mechanism has been implemented, significantly reducing the performance impact of animations and ensuring a fluid browsing experience even on less powerful devices.

- "Scroll to Top" Button: A new, accessible "Scroll to Top" button has been implemented to improve navigation on long pages, providing a smoother and more intuitive user journey.
